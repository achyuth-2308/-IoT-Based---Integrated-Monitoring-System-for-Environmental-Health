IoT Based - Integrated Monitoring System for Environmental Health
The Monitoring System is planned with the intention of providing industrially reliable dataon the noise, air, and pH levels of the environment. It ought to move the data reader and suggest measures that can be 
taken to improve the much-needed overall environmental quality. 
It also includes domestic usage of the data to shape the healthy lives of aged individuals.

The metro cities of our nation have turned into large Smog-clouds, noisy and acidic pH environments. The frail governance of the drainage plants and landfills for garbage have
made plant growth a question mark around the cities. IoT systems in and around our nation have been created with this in mind. 
Various systems have obtained data on the particulate matter. For instance, an air quality sensing device called “Smart Air” and a web server to document the obtained data has been demonstrated. 
It has been developed based on IoT technology to efficiently monitor the air quality and transmit the data to a web server via LTE in real time. 
The device is composed of a microcontroller, pollutant detection sensors, and LTE modem. 

In the research, the device was designed to measure a concentration of aerosol, VOC, CO, CO2, and temperature-humidity to monitor the air quality. Then, the device was successfully tested for reliability 
by following the prescribed procedure from the Ministry of Environment, Korea. Such systems have allowed monitoring of the air conditions and assessed the quality of the environment.

On the face of our production, we propose to build a system that takes the data of the PM (Particulate Matter), Noise levels (dB), and pH levels. We also propose to craft an interface
that tells the user the current conditions in the environment. This targets the seekers of weather quality information and informs them of the conditions thereof.
